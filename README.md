I am working on a NETFLIX Clone with API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/

**Technologies**
1.	React hooks (state, effect, context, custom hooks)
2.	React routers
3.	React portal
4.	Sass

The project is unfinished and ongoing (updated 11.11.2021)

Note: Since github pages is not very effective in hosting a react app that uses react-router, there might be some bugs in my website. I will soon transfer the app to another host.

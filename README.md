The project is unfinished and ongoing (updated 11.11.2021)

**API**

	The Movie Databse: https://www.themoviedb.org/
 
**Technologies**

	1. React hooks (state, effect, context, custom hooks)
	2. React routers
	3. React portal
	4. Sass

**Web’s structure:**

	1. DOM: root, modal 
	2. Pages: Home, Movies, TV Shows, My List, Search
	3. Components: Navbar, Billboard, Carousel, Movie card, Modal

**Future update with back-end development**

	1. Updating the “Add movie” function and display them in My List page.
	2. New login page with feature for users to create accounts. Each user will have their own account containing their added movies.

**Note:** 
    Since github pages is not very effective in hosting a react app that uses react-router, there might be some bugs in my website. I will soon transfer the app to another host.
